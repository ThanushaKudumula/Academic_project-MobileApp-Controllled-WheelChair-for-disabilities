# Academic_project-MobileApp-Controllled-WheelChair-for-disabilities


In today's world, we're concerned about helping people with physical challenges move around more easily. The project is 
about creating a special wheelchair that can be controlled in two ways: by talking and using a mobile app. Users command 
the wheelchair through a cellular device, which communicates via Bluetooth to an Arduino-equipped wheelchair.Voice prompts
such as "Forward","Back","Left", "Right" and "Stop" initiate corresponding movements. This makes it easier for people to 
move on their own.To make things even better, a phone app can be developed that works with the wheelchair. This app has
buttons you can tap to control the wheelchair like a remote control. The wheelchair is also equipped with ultrasonic 
sensors. These sensors continuously scan the surroundings for obstacles to avoid a collision.All these features make moving
around much easier for people who might have trouble getting around on their own.
